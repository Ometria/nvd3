## Novus is no longer developing nvd3

I emailed them and asked.  The company is apparently no longer having the employees work on it, and the person who was working on the 2.x refactor left the company back in June 2014.

## Introducing the nvd3-community organization! 

https://github.com/nvd3-community/nvd3/

It's already several versions ahead of the old novus code, and contains over 30 bug fixes, several pull requests I manually brought over, many new features, documentation, a new examples site, and a standardized code base.

All further development will be done there instead of my personal repo.

Please clone from there, and report bugs there.  I also registered it with bower as "nvd3-community".
